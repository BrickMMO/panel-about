This application will provide BrickMMO developers with a place to login and receive their daily tasks and deadlines.

This application will intentionally be written in a simplified structure with a simple stack. This will provide BrickMMO developers with a simple application to contribute to once they have some understanding of server-side languages such as PHP.
